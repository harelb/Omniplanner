"""Regression tests for goal-relevant PDDL grounding (scene_scope).

These verify that:
  * dynamic, goal-based pruning produces a much smaller PDDL problem than the
    legacy "full" scope,
  * the pruned problem still yields a valid plan that achieves the goal, and
  * the legacy "full" scope still works.

Runnable both under pytest and directly:
