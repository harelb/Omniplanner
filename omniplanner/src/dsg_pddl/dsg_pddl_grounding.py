    Every other place-symbol source in this module (get_places_layer,
    extract_all_symbols, object_current_place, the distance LayerPlanner, ...)
    is keyed off MESH_PLACES ("P"). To keep place-in-region facts consistent
    with those, this walks the real-graph shape first and only falls back to
    a second shape if that yields nothing:

      (a) MESH_PLACES nodes parented directly under ROOMS. This is the real
          hydra/camp-graph shape: the region_injector adds room->MESH_PLACES
          membership, and the 3D PLACES layer may be empty entirely. This is
          also the original (pre object-in-region-derived-predicate) behavior
          of this function.
      (b) ROOMS nodes whose children resolve to place-type nodes (3D PLACES
          or MESH_PLACES). This covers scene graphs (e.g. the synthetic test
          fixture in examples/utils.py:build_test_dsg) where MESH_PLACES is
          registered as a non-primary/orthogonal layer partition (e.g. layer
          id 20, above ROOMS at layer id 4) that can never acquire a graph
          parent via insert_edge -- node.parents() stays empty regardless of
          which edges are inserted -- so those fixtures instead parent rooms
          directly over the 3D PLACES layer.

    (b) is run ONLY IF (a) produced zero facts -- it is a fallback, not a
    union. On real hydra maps, rooms parent 3D PLACES nodes *in addition to*
    MESH_PLACES nodes, and normalize_symbol's case-collapsing ("p<i>"/"P<i>"
    collide, since both layers number from 0) means path (b)'s 3D-place-keyed
    facts alias unrelated MESH_PLACES symbols whenever the two layers share an
    index -- corrupting place-in-region truth values for downstream full-scope
    and multirobot consumers. Falling back only when (a) is empty preserves
    the toy fixture (whose MESH_PLACES layer never has parents, so (a) is
    always empty there) while restoring exact pre-change behavior -- (a) only
    -- on real graphs.
